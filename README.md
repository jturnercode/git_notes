- who changes it, why, etc

Git is local enabled from command line and does not need server but is available.  

Github is a online server to hold and share repositories for git.  


Git is fast and modern:

- collaboration: people working on the same files
- not just for programmers: designers and documet authors (knowledge workers)
- visual way to look at history
