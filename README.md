Repository to document and learn git better &amp; some markdown  


## What is Git?
What is version control?  
&emsp;Helps with coding process: Create, save, edit, and then save again  

Can describe why or what changes were made.  
- helps when doing collaboration
- who changes it, why, etc

Git is local enabled from command line and does not need server but is available.  

Github is a online server to hold and share repositories for git.  


Git is fast and modern:
- provides history of content changes
- collaboration: people working on the same files
- not just for programmers: designers and documet authors (knowledge workers)
- visual way to look at history
