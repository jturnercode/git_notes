# Git Branches  

List, create, or delete branches

If **--list** is given, or if there are no non-option arguments, existing branches are listed; the current branch will be highlighted in green and marked with an asterisk. Any branches checked out in linked worktrees will be highlighted in cyan and marked with a plus sign. 

Option **-r** causes the remote-tracking branches to be listed, and option **-a** shows both local and remote branches.
